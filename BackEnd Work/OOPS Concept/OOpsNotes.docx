                                           OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
                                                 Features with its Defination
                
                
                 1. Inheritance (Reuseablity).
                
                
                 2. Polymorphism (One name many forms).
                
                
                 3. Encaptulation (Blinding data menber and menber function in single unit)||(Data hiding).
                
                
                 4. Abstraction (Show functionality only hide complexity).
                
                
                 5. Object (Anything in this real world is know as an Object)&&(Any thing in this Real world is known as Object ),(Physically Exist).
                Ex Pen,Makers ,Laptop etc.
                Object(Real World)                                  Object(Computer)
                 -> Properties(State)                               Data member(Instance Variable)

                 ->Behaviour                                        Member function(Method)
                
                 Data Member                                            Member Function
                 1. Non static                                          Non static                 
                 2. Static                                              Static

                 Rule  :-   non static things is always belongs to Object .
                 Rule  :-   Static thing always belongs to class.
                
                 6. Class (Defination of the object is class).    
                    Defination of class :-  class is a collection of similar type of objects .(logical Entity).
                    class is Template or blueprint of Objects.

                    Ex :- class<class Name>
                    {
                        Field 
                        Method
                        constructor
                        block
                        nested class
                    }
        In java there are 4 ways to initialize Instance Variable
        -> By Reference
        -> By Method
        -> By constructor
        -> By Init Block (Instance initialize Block).

        5 many ways to create object in java 
        -> By new Keyword 
        -> By Factory Method
        -> By newInstance() Method
        ->By clone () method
        -> By Deserialization
