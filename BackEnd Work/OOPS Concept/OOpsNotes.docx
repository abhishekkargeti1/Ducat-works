                                           OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
                                                 Features with its Defination
                
                
                 1. Inheritance (Reuseablity).
                
                
                 2. Polymorphism (One name many forms).
                
                
                 3. Encaptulation (Blinding data member and member function in single unit)||(Data hiding).
                
                
                 4. Abstraction (Show functionality only hide complexity).
                
                
                 5. Object (Anything in this real world is know as an Object)&&(Any thing in this Real world is known as Object ),(Physically Exist).
                Ex Pen,Makers ,Laptop etc.
                Object(Real World)                                  Object(Computer)
                 -> Properties(State)                               Data member(Instance Variable)

                 ->Behaviour                                        Member function(Method)
                
                 Data Member                                            Member Function
                 1. Non static                                          Non static                 
                 2. Static                                              Static

                 Rule  :-   non static things is always belongs to Object .
                 Rule  :-   Static thing always belongs to class.
                
                 6. Class (Defination of the object is class).    
                    Defination of class :-  class is a collection of similar type of objects .(logical Entity).
                    class is Template or blueprint of Objects.

                    Ex :- class<class Name>
                    {
                        Field 
                        Method
                        constructor
                        block
                        nested class
                    }
        In java there are 4 ways to initialize Instance Variable
        -> By Reference
        -> By Method
        -> By constructor
        -> By Init Block (Instance initialize Block).

        5 many ways to create object in java 
        -> By new Keyword 
        -> By Factory Method
        -> By newInstance() Method
        ->By clone () method
        -> By Deserialization 

Anonymous object :-
            It means nameless .. An object which has no Reference is know asan Anonymous object . It can be used at the run time of object creation only.

            syntax :-
             new temp(); Anonymous object
            calling method through Anonymous object
            new temp().setData();


    Example :-

    class anonymousObject {
    String penBrand;
    String penColor;
    String penInkcolor;
    double penPrice;
    void setData(String brand ,String color,String inkColor , double price){
        penBrand = brand;
        penColor = color;
        penInkcolor = inkColor;
        penPrice = price;
        displayData();
    }
    void displayData(){
        System.out.println("Brand "+ penBrand);
        System.out.println("Color "+ penColor);
        System.out.println("Ink Color "+ penInkcolor);
        System.out.println("Price "+ penPrice);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        new anonymousObject().setData("uni-ball","Red","Black",2000.00);
    }    
}

Creation of object of one type only in single line 

    class test {
        String micName;
        int price;
        void setData(String name,int micPrice){
            micName = name;
            price = micPrice;
        }
        void displayData(){
            System.out.println("Mic name is "+ micName); 
            System.out.println("Mic price is "+ price); 
        }
        public static void main(String []args){
            test t1 = new test(),t2= new test(),t3 = new test();  // Creation of object of one type only in single line 
        }
    }

    this Keyword in java :-

    In Java this is a Reference Variable that holds Reference id of current object Reference id .(Object)


OOPS 1 :-
Rule 1 :- whenever class level Variable (Instance Variable)and local Variable both are having same name then this concept is know as Data shodowing
